  <h1>Installation</h1>
  <p>Installation will be done through <b>NPM</b> system.</p>
  <h2>NPM</h2>
  <p>
    <b>NPM</b> is packaging system with largest software
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">registry</a>. It allows easily creating and
    sharing packages written in <b>javascript</b>. It is similar to
    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">pip</a> for <b>python</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    NPM is installed as part of <b>nodejs</b> which is available at school
    computers.
  </p>
  <p>NPM is used through command line.</p>
  <h2>NPM init</h2>
  <p>
    First of all we will use <code>npm init</code> which is interactive
    walkthrough to set up package/project.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will create package.json file in repository which contains information
    for our package. In the end we will not be uploading the package so
    information does not need to be complete.
  </p>
  <h2>NPM install</h2>
  <p>
    Then we need to download Eleventy from registry to use it in our project.
    That is done via npm command install:
    <code>npm install {package-name}</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    This would add package to all dependencies which is not what we need this
    time as Eleventy will be used only in development, for that reason we will
    use <code>npm install -D @11ty/eleventy</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    This will edit package.json and add new <b>package-lock.json</b> file and
    folder <b>node_modules</b> . File <b>package-lock.json</b> contains
    information what packages are used in this project including dependencies.
    Folder <b>node_modules</b> contains all installed (downloaded) packages.
  </p>
